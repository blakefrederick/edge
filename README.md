# Next.js Edge API

A readme explaining that I'm just testing out a Next.js feature.

The feature in question: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes

Deployed with Vercel: https://edge-rosy.vercel.app/

Instructions: Use Postman or whatever to test the fastness and slowness of Node routes v Edge routes. (Secret: Edge is about 2x faster)
